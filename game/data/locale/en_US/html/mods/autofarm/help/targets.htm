<br>
You have the option to define which monsters your character should or should not target.
<br>Note that adding one to your list does not guarantee it will be attacked, as it must be physically accessible to your character.
<br>
If you enable the option to attack Raid Bosses, they will appear on your list, and you can choose a specific one.
<br>
If no targets are selected, all visible monsters will be attacked.
