<br>
Choose up to six skills for your character to use automatically while the AutoFarm is active.
<br>
Buffs will be used whenever your character does not have the respective effect active, or if you have a debuff that can be removed by them.
<br>
Attack skills can have different ranges, so they can define the maximum attack radius and/or be used only when the target is close enough.
<br>
Debuffs will always be used on the first attack and then based on a chance thereafter.
<br>
Item creation skills, such as Summon CP Potion, Quiver of Arrows, and Summon Cursed Bones are also supported.
