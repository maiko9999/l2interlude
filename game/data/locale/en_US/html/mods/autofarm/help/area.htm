<br>
There are three types of area:
<br>
<font color=LEVEL>- Zones</font>
<br>
Through the editor, you can define multiple points that set the boundary of a custom zone, and your character will move within it.
<br>
<font color=LEVEL>- Routes</font>
<br>
Again, our editor allows you to create points, but this time they indicate a path that your character should follow.
<br>
<font color=LEVEL>- Open</font>
<br>
In these areas, there is no need to create a specific area; just select it and all monsters within your attack range will be attacked.
<br>
Whenever you create a zone or route, it is necessary to save them after creating or editing them. This ensures they are saved in our database, so you won't lose them.
