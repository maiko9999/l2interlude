You can set how many minutes the AutoFarm should stay active before automatically shutting down. If no value is specified, the system will remain active until you manually stop it.
<br>
By using this option, you also gain the ability to use a <a action="bypass autofarm macro">macro</a> that allows for a custom action to be performed when the timer ends.
